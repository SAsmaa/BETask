# BETask

this api is not implemented
. **_POST_** `/balances/deposit/:userId` 
should be the same as other post api

for unit tests no enough time to write.


according to this point to fix this one
**_GET_** `/contracts/:id`

i know how but leave it also for time but the solution somthing similar to call multiple method depends on each other same as in post api i did
